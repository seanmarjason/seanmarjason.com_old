#My Personal Website

While I've already created a basic website using the "all powerful" Wordpress, I wanted to challenge myself to create my own site from scratch. Adding in the styles, interactions, and content that I WANT to include, rather than relying on generic templates.

This project started with an initial design. Taking tips from Steve Krug's ["Don't Make Me Think"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) and inspiration from a wide array of sources including other websites, interesting illustrations, and of course my favourite set designs of all, Blade Runner both old and new!, I prepared an initial set of designs in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

Then, taking a mobile-first approach, the site came together.

I hope you enjoy browsing my content, and exploring the interesting interactions that I have (and still want to) build!
